Developed a fully responsive weather application using React JS, Material UI, Chart.js, and Recharts. Users can check the current weather status of any location by entering its name. 

The application also provides a 7-day weather forecast and a 6-hour weather forecast in the form of attractive charts.

For obtaining current weather data and hourly forecasts, I utilized the Weatherbit API. For geocoding, I used the Geoapify API.
